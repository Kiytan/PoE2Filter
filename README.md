# PoE2Filter
A basic filter for PoE2. It does not hide anything

Most of the colour and style is based on Neversinks Lunaris theme.

I've also added a version that uses Setharial's D2 sounds for those that prefer it.

There's still a few items that need to be added, higher tier currencies and endgame stuff mostly, but I haven't got there yet so don't have the items to test with. 

Below is an example image, it doesn't cover everything but should give you an idea.
